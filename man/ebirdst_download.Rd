\title{Download eBird Status and Trends Data}
\usage{
ebirdst_download(species, path = rappdirs::user_data_dir("ebirdst"),
  tifs_only = TRUE, force = FALSE)

download_data(species, path = rappdirs::user_data_dir("ebirdst"),
  tifs_only = TRUE, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{character; a single species given as a scientific name, common
name or six-letter species code (e.g. woothr). The full list of valid
species is can be viewed in the \link{ebirdst_runs} data frame included in this
package. To download the example dataset, use "example_data".}

\item{path}{character; directory to download the data to. All downloaded
files will be placed in a sub-directory of this directory named according
to the unique run ID associated with this species. Defaults to a persistent
data directory, which can be found by calling
rappdirs::user_data_dir("ebirdst")).}

\item{tifs_only}{logical; whether to only download the GeoTIFFs for
abundance and occurrence (the default), or download the entire data
package, including data for predictor importance, partial dependence, and
predictive performance metrics.}

\item{force}{logical; if the data have already been downloaded, should a
fresh copy be downloaded anyway.}
}
\value{
Path to the run-specific root of the downloaded files.
}
\description{
Download an eBird Status and Trends data package for a single species, or for
an example species, to a specified path. The example data consist of the
results for Yellow-bellied Sapsucker subset to Michigan and are much smaller
than the full dataset making these data quicker to download and process.
