\title{Labels 52 week RasterStack with the dates for each band}
\usage{
label_raster_stack(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{RasterStack} or \code{RasterBrick}; original eBird Status and Trends
product raster GeoTiff with 52 bands, one for each week.}
}
\value{
A \code{RasterStack} or \code{RasterBrick} with names assigned for the dates in
the format of "XYYYY.MM.DD" per raster package constraints. The Raster*
objects do not allow the names to start with a number, nor are they allowed
to contain "-", so it is not possible to store the date in an ISO compliant
format.
}
\description{
The \code{raster} package does not allow layer names to be saved with the bands of
a multi-band GeoTiff. Accordingly, all eBird Status and Trends products
raster results cover the entire 52 week temporal extent of analysis. For
convenience, this function labels the RasterStack once it has been loaded
with the dates for each band.
