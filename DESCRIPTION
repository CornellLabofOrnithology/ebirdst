Description: Tools to download, map, plot and analyze eBird Status and
    Trends data (<https://ebird.org/science/status-and-trends>). eBird
    (<https://ebird.org>) is a global database of bird observations
    collected by citizen scientists. eBird Status and Trends uses these
    data to model continental bird abundances, range boundaries, habitat
    associations, and trends.
